#Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number. 
#(If you donâ€™t know what a divisor is it is a number that divides evenly into another number. For example, 12 is a divisor of 24 because 24 / 12 has no remainder.)

number = int(input('Enter the number: '))

list1= list(range(1, number +1))

divisor_list =[]

for i in list1:
    if number % i ==0:
        divisor_list.append(i)

print(divisor_list)


Output:

Enter the number:  12
[1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12]
