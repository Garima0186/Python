#write a program that returns a list that contains only the elementsthat are common between the lists (without duplicates).
Make sure your program works on two lists of different sizes.

a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 115, 21, 9, 55, 89]
b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 9, 10, 11, 12, 115]

a= set(a)
b= set(b)

common_elements = a.intersection(b)
result = list(common_elements)
print(result)

Output: 
[1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 115]
